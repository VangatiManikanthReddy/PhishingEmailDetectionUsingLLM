The only way I have ever gotten the nvidia drivers to not hang (using swsusp, tuxonice, uswsusp, whatever) is to use suspend-to-ram after disabling whatever magic video card hackery the distro tries (on the theory that the nvidia binary driver knows more about the quirks my card has than the sleep scripts the distro uses). > Michael > > > _______________________________________________ > TuxOnIce-users mailing list > enpsfhxz-stvnz@lists.tuxonice.net > http://lists.tuxonice.net/mailman/listinfo/tuxonice-users > ------------------------------ >From nlnpr@nigel.suspend2.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 08:10:19 +1100 From: Nigel Cunningham  Subject: Re: [TuxOnIce-users] [TuxOnIce-devel] 3.0-rc5 released.

Alternatively, you can just set the  default console level higher than 1, or change it while hibernation is  running. This assumes that you have PM_DEBUG enabled.

As input I take data from a relational database. Below is a sample from this table stored in a MySQL database. Each row represents an \\\"EVENT\\\": ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1    t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3    t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_10  t3 : j    USER_1   EVENT_1     t_i j+1  USER_2   EVENT_4   t_i+1 : N    USER_A   EVENT_3   t_z ID: unique for each row. USER_X: USER with X an element from the set [0 .. A) identifying a user. EVENT_Y: EVENT with Y an element from the set [0 .. B) identifying an event. Conneting to the database works fine. Now, I would like to obtain the following format: A \\\"User-based B-dimensional vector/dictionary\\\" of all events where each position in this vector space corresponds to an event and holds a binary value - 0 or 1 - indicating whether the event occured or not. So duplicates are neglected. For the sample table below with B =3D 7 (indicating that there a 7 different events, numbered 0 through 6), this might look like: ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1   t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3   t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_4   t3 4    USER_1   EVENT_6   t4 5    USER_2   EVENT_5   t5 USER_1: (0,1,0,1,1,0,1) USER_2: (0,0,0,0,0,1,0) I hope that someone can help me out.

There are lots of great books available, which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools, artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods, some of which are implemented in Weka. Here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights: 1. To start with, Whitten & Frank's book on Data Mining is a great one. This is the book Weka refers to. There are also ones by Han; D. Hand on the same topic and widely used. 2. For Artificial Intelligence, Russel and Norvig; or Winston; or Knight or Charniak are widely read authors. In addition to all the books, there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides, papers, articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy. MIT has a great open source tutorial, most good Universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read. Hope this should help, Regards, Subrat ________________________________ From: mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz [mailto:mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz] On Behalf Of Andhra Loyola College Sent: Thursday, February 07, 2008 12:13 PM To: iuxxdkqk@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz Subject: [Wekalist] where can i find algorithms explanation dear weka forum,                         I had gone through all the documentations present in source forge, but i could not find clear explanation of the algorithms.Can some one tell me where i can find them in Internet. thank u. sunanda ________________________________ Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
